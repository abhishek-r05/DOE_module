# DOE_module
This is module to call multiple library (currently pyDOE, diversipy) to create a latin hyper cube sampling method. 
This module also provides features on manipulating LHS and helpful functions for usage. 
Some of the usage include:
1. apply customize probability for each variable.
2. adding new points to existing LHS matrix.
3. Measuring distance and correlation between variables.
4. Plotting and visualization matrix.


There is a ipynb uploaded which walks over basic usage of the module.
There is a pre-requisite to import supporting module like pyDOE and diversipy. These library have the implementation of algorithms to create
latin hypercube.
